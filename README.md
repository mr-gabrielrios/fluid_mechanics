# Fluid Mechanics Scripts
The intent of this repo is to collect a bunch of scripts that I made to help visualize concepts in fluid mechanics, starting with my Fundamentals of Fluid Mechanics course (City College of New York, ENGR I0800).

Intended to be a working repo and will add scripts as needed. Feel free to reach out with any questions (chances are I won't be able to answer them if they're about fluid mechanics).

### Current scripts
* `potential_flow.py`
    * Used to visualize irrotational, inviscid, incompressible flow in a 2D Cartesian space.
